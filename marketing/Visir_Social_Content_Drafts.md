# Visir SNS 콘텐츠 초안

## 1. Twitter/X 콘텐츠

### 스레드 1: 공감형 바이럴 (Before/After)

탭 지옥에 공감대를 형성하고, Visir의 해결책을 자연스럽게 소개하는 스레드입니다.

**Tweet 1 (Hook)**
```
Raise your hand if this is your daily setup 🙋

- Gmail tab
- Slack tab
- Google Calendar tab
- Notion tab
- Todoist tab
- Another Gmail (different account)
- Random spreadsheet

If you're drowning in tabs, this thread is for you 🧵
```

**Tweet 2**
```
Here's the real problem:

Read email → Open calendar → Create event → Back to email → Check Slack → Back to calendar...

You're spending 2+ hours/day just SWITCHING between apps.

Not working. Switching.
```

**Tweet 3**
```
So we built Visir.

✅ All your inboxes in one view
✅ Drag any email/Slack message → drops right into your calendar
✅ AI that actually knows "what did I do yesterday?"

7 tabs → 1 window
```

**Tweet 4**
```

This is it.
Read it. Drag it. Scheduled.

No copy-paste. No tab switching. No friction.

Your tab hell ends today 🚀

### 스레드 2: 창업자 스토리

창업 배경과 개인적인 pain point를 공유해서 진정성을 보여주는 스레드입니다.

**Tweet 1**
```
3 years ago, I realized something painful.

40% of my day as a startup founder was spent... switching between productivity apps.

Not building. Not thinking. Just switching.

So I decided to fix it 🧵
```

**Tweet 2**
```
The problem I identified:

1️⃣ Information comes in via email/Slack
2️⃣ Planning happens in calendar/todo apps
3️⃣ Connecting them is 100% manual

Why are "reading" and "planning" separate activities?
```

**Tweet 3**
```
Visir's core idea:

"Reduce Input → Output friction to zero"

See an email that needs a meeting?
→ Drag it to your calendar. Done.

Get a request on Slack?
→ Convert it to a task instantly.
```

**Tweet 4**
```
And then there's the AI agent.

"What did I work on for marketing last week?"

→ Searches your calendar, completed tasks, sent emails
→ Summarizes everything

Let AI remember. You just execute.
```

**Tweet 5 (CTA)**
```

If you're tired of tab hell, give it a try.
Would love your feedback 🙏

### 단독 트윗 시리즈

개별적으로 올릴 수 있는 단독 트윗들입니다. 각각 다른 각도에서 제품을 소개합니다.

**공감형 1**
```
The irony of productivity apps making you less productive 🤡

App 1: Check email
App 2: Check Slack
App 3: Check calendar
App 4: Check todo list
App 5: Back to email...

There's a better way.
```

**공감형 2**
```
"Wait, when was that meeting?"

→ Open calendar
→ Scroll, scroll, scroll
→ Can't find it, search email
→ Found it... but what did we discuss?

Or just ask AI. 3 seconds.
```

**기능 소개 1** (드래그앤드롭)
```
[GIF: Email → Task conversion]

Reading an email and thinking "I should do this later"?

One click → Task created.
Title, date, email link — all automatic.
```

**기능 소개 2** (프로젝트 뷰)
```
See all emails, Slack messages, and tasks for one project in a single view.

Click "Project A" and get:
→ All related emails
→ All related Slack channels
→ All related tasks

One click. Full context. Zero switching.
```

**핵심 메시지**
```
You don't need another productivity app.

You need fewer apps that actually work together.

That's Visir.
```

**소셜 프루프** (론칭 후 사용)
```
"I got 2 hours of my day back."

That's what beta users keep telling us.

Not because Visir does more.
Because it eliminates the switching tax.
```

## 2. LinkedIn 콘텐츠

### 포스트 1: 인사이트형

생산성 앱의 역설에 대한 깊은 분석으로 thought leadership을 보여주는 포스트입니다.

```
Why do we use 7 productivity apps and still feel unproductive?

After 3 years of running a startup, I discovered an uncomfortable truth.

The problem isn't the apps. It's the gaps between them.

Here's what a typical day looks like:
• Receive information via email
• Transfer it to calendar as an event
• Get a request on Slack
• Transfer it to a todo app as a task

This "transferring" takes an average of 2 hours per day.

So I built a solution.

Visir — a platform that unifies all communication channels and task management into one.

The key is simple:
✓ Drag email/Slack → Instant calendar event
✓ AI remembers all context and searches for you
✓ Group everything by project automatically

I eliminated the boundary between "reading" and "planning."

Currently in public beta.

### 포스트 2: 창업자 스토리

개인적인 경험을 공유하며 제품의 탄생 배경을 설명하는 포스트입니다.

```
"Not another calendar-email dance..."

That was my most frustrating moment as a startup CEO in 2022.

To schedule a single meeting:
1. Check their email
2. Open my calendar
3. Find available time
4. Go back to email, reply
5. Once confirmed, add to calendar again

Why does this take 5 steps?

That evening, I wrote on my whiteboard:
"Reduce Input → Output friction to zero."

18 months later, Visir was born.

Now:
• Drag an email to your calendar. Done.
• Ask AI "What's important this week?" Get an instant answer.
• All your apps work in one window.

The most rewarding moment as a founder:
When a beta user said, "I finally escaped tab hell."

If you share this frustration, drop a comment.
I'd love to build better workflows together.

### 포스트 3: 사용 사례

실제 베타 유저의 피드백을 활용한 사회적 증거 포스트입니다.

```
"My email processing time dropped by 40%."

Feedback from one of our beta users.

Their old workflow:
→ Check email in Gmail
→ Copy important stuff to Notion
→ Add schedule-related items to Google Calendar

Now:
→ Check email in Visir

→ Done

"With almost zero context switching, I finish planning while reading emails."

## 3. Reddit/커뮤니티 콘텐츠

### ProductHunt 론칭 카피

PH 론칭 시 사용할 핵심 카피입니다.

**Tagline:**
```
All your inboxes in one place. Every message becomes an action.
```

**Short Description:**
```
Visir unifies email, Slack, calendar, and tasks into one intelligent workspace.
Drag-and-drop any message to your timeline. Ask AI about your work history.
Stop tab-switching, start doing.
```

**Maker Comment:**
```
Hey PH! 👋

I'm [Name], founder of Visir.

For 3 years, I ran a startup and realized I was spending 2+ hours/day just
switching between productivity apps. Gmail → Calendar → Slack → Todoist → repeat.

So I built what I wished existed:

🔗 Unified Inbox: Email + Slack + notifications in one view
⚡ Instant Actions: Drag any message to your calendar/tasks
🤖 Context-Aware AI: "What did I do last week?" → instant summary

The core insight: "Reading" and "Planning" shouldn't be separate activities.

We're in public beta and would love your feedback!

What's your biggest productivity pain point? Let me know in the comments 👇

### r/productivity 포스트

Reddit 커뮤니티에 맞는 자연스럽고 진정성 있는 톤의 포스트입니다.

**Title:**
```
I built a tool that unifies all my inboxes and lets me drag emails straight to my calendar
```

**Post:**
```
Hey r/productivity!

Like many of you, I was drowning in tabs: Gmail, Slack, Google Calendar, Todoist...

The worst part? The constant context switching. Read an email about a meeting →
open calendar → find a time → go back to email → reply → forget to add it to
todo list...

So I built Visir.

**What it does:**
- Shows all your inboxes (email + Slack) in one unified view
- You can literally drag any message and drop it onto your calendar to schedule it
- AI assistant that knows all your connected data ("What did I do on the
  Marketing project last week?")
- Groups everything by project so you see related emails, chats, and tasks together

**Early results from beta users:**
- 40% less time on email processing
- Near-zero context switching for planning

It's free to try during beta. Would love feedback from this community -
you all understand the pain 😅

Link in comments (if allowed) or DM me!

"That's literally it"
"No more tab switching"

Text: "Why did no one think of this before?"
```

**영상 3: AI 기능 데모**

AI 어시스턴트 기능을 보여주는 영상입니다.

```
"When you can't remember what you did yesterday"

[AI chat interface]

"Let AI remember for you"
```
